%   Announcement:   Not debug free. Feel free to do any modifications and
%                   use it at will
%-Inputs:
% @data1: datas that might share data at same time as @data2
% @data2: datas that might share data at same time as @data1
% @th: threshold, if difference between two quantity is less than @th then we say they are the same
%-Outputs:
% @Ids1: array that includes all found element id in @data1
% @Ids2: array that includes all id in @data2 of founded element in @data1
